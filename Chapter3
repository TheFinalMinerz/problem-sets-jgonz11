 1.	List the steps for converting a truth table to a circuit
- Draw and AND gate for each term with a 1 in the result column
- Wire the AND gates to the appropiate inputs
- Feed the output of all the AND gates into an OR gate

2. Why are NAND and NOR know as complete gates?
Because any Boolean function can be computed using either of them. No other gate
has this property, which is another reason they are often preferred for the building
block of circuits.

3.	Define combinational circuit
Circuit with multiple inputs and ooutputs in which the outputs are uniquely determined by the current 
input values.

4.	What is the formula for the number of data lines for a given number of control lines for a multiplexer?
2^n data inputs

5.	What is the formula for the number output lines for a given number of control lines for a decoder?
2^n output lines
