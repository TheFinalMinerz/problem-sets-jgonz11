Working in question 1
Intel 8088 0.750 MIPS at 10.00 MHz MIPS = 0.075
Intel Core i7 Extreme Edition 980X 147 600 MIPS at 3.33 GHz  MIPS = 7.46

1 second = 1000 milliseconds

a-) How many milliseconds would it take to run 1,000,000 8088-ISA level instructions on this 8088?

total time = 1 / (0.075 * 1 000 000)
           = 1 / 75 000 = 1.333x10^-5 seconds = 0.013 milliseconds

b-) How many milliseconds would it take to run 1,000,000 Core i7 instructions on this Core i7?

total time = 1 / (7.46 * 1 000 000)
           = 1 /  7 460 000 = 1.34048x10^-4 seconds = 0.0013 milliseconds
           
d-) Yes, hardware implementation is always faster than a software implementation because software
    has to be executed in the hardware of where it resides. Therefore, to excetute any instruction 
    the processor has to perform a sequence of steps that hardware does not have to do. 
    
2.

    Pentium in 1993

c-) First Intel computer with a superscalar pipeline

    Pentium in 1993

d-) First product line developed as a family.

    360 made by IBM in 1964

e-) Computer that marked the start of modern computer history

f-) First vector computer

     CRAY-1 made by Cray in 1974

g-) First commercial RISC machine

    MIPS in 1985

h-) First computer with a bus for I/O

    PDP-8 in 1960's

i-) First dual-core chip

POWER4 made by IBM in 2001

3. Implement the Interp function from class. The main program has been given already, write all the missing routines.
I have modified the code a little from the example from class. The find_data returns the location of the data, not
the data. This allows more flexibility.

LOAD_CONST 000
LOAD       001
STORE      010
ADD        011
SUB        100
HALT       101

LOAD__CONST  3
STORE        7
LOAD_CONST   2
ADD          7
STORE        9

----------------
 000 00011
 010 00111
 000 00010
 011 00111
 010 01001
 101 00000


4. Each stage in a five-stage pipleline executes in one cycle. How many cycles will it take to process 100 instructions
from the moment that the first instruction enters the pipeline to the moment the last instruction leaves the pipeline?

104 cycles

5. Suppose it takes 100 nsec to access RAM, 60 nsec to access L2 cache, and 10 nsec to access L1 cache. 
If L1 cache has a hit rate of 60% and L2 has a hit rate of 80%, what is the average access time to retrieve data from memory? 

For L1: (0.6 * 10) + (0.4 * 100) = 46 nsec

For L2: (0.8 * 60) + (0.2 * 100) = 48 + 20 = 68 nsec

46 + 68 = 114 nsec

6. Consider a student record with name, age, and major number. The name is Pat Adams, the age is 19, the major number is 2022. Show how the data would be stored in a memory system that has 4-byte words as follows. Draw the memory as a linear array of bytes, not as a table. Store numbers in hex.

    Store the data using Big Endian
    Store the data using Little Endian
Big Endian: PAT _ADAM_S000_00013_0007E6
Little Endian: TAP_MADA_000S_13000_E60700

7. Here are two Boolean formulas.

      A OR B
      (A OR B)C OR (A OR B)(NOT C)

   a. Prove whether or not these equations are equivalent by using truth tables. Do not simplify the expressions.
   A  B  C  AorB  AND C  (AorB)(notC) RESULT
   0  0  0   0      0          0         0
   0  0  1   0      0          0         0
   0  1  0   1      0          1         1
   1  0  0   1      0          1         1
   0  1  1   1      1          0         1
   1  1  0   1      0          1         1
   1  1  1   1      1          0         1
   
  9. Truth tables and Boolean formulas.

   a. Create a truth table for a circuit that is one when the parity of its three inputs is even. 
A  B  C  out
1  1  0   1
0  1  1   1
1  0  1   1
