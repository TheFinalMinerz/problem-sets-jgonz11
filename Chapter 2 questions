1. What are the three main parts of the CPU?
Control Unit
Arithmetic logical unit (ALU)
Registers

2. Define the PC register
Small piece of memory very fast
Next to the CPU

3. Define the IR register
Holds the instructions currently being executed

4. What constitutes a data path?
Data path is formed for registers, the ALU and several buses connecting the pieces

5. List three advantages of microcode over hardware implementation.

- The opportunity to add new instructions at minimal cost
- Ability to fix design deficiencies
- Breaks instructions of its target machine into small steps. Efficient development.
