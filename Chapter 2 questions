1. What are the three main parts of the CPU?
Control Unit
Arithmetic logical unit (ALU)
Registers

2. Define the PC register
High-speed memory to store temporary result
Next to the CPU

3. Define the IR register
Holds the instructions currently being executed

4. What constitutes a data path?
Data path is formed for registers, the ALU and several buses connecting the pieces

5. List three advantages of microcode over hardware implementation.

- The opportunity to add new instructions at minimal cost
- Ability to fix design deficiencies
- Breaks instructions of its target machine into small steps. Efficient development.

6. How did fast read-only memory help diminish the disadvantage of interpretation over a hardware implementation? 
Interpreters could be run over the control stores to 
diminish the interpretation overhead, since control
stores were faster than conventional RW memory at the
time.

7. What was the new (old?) development in the RISC design?
VLSI Very Large Scale Integration

8. How did the RISC designers justify that their design was faster, even though it took 4 or 5 instructions to
do the equivalent of 1 CISC instruction. 
RISC design instruction are 10 times as fast as CISC because they are not interpreted
